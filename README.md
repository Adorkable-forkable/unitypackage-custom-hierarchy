## Instructions
1. Download the latest released version of the .unitypackage here (https://github.com/febucci/unitypackage-custom-hierarchy/releases) and import it in Unity.<br> *[Alternative: download the Source Code and copy the "Assets" folder content inside your project's "Asset" folder.]*
2. Go to the menu item "Tools/Febucci/CustomHierarchy/Initialize or Create", and if a prompt appears click yes.
3. The Custom Hierarchy is now activated and you can edit its related 'Settings' file (which is selected every time you click on the previous menu item).

*P.S. You can delete the 'Example' folder if you don't need it anymore.*

TODO: make the package available through the Unity Package Manager <3 (via a GIT url)
